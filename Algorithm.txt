Algorithm 1:

1. Get 30 inputs from the user

	check if the input is greater than or equal to 0 or less than 30

	if yes, error display should be visible

	if no, we print the marks till we get all 30 

2.Calculate the highest mark

	make a variable for maximum marks and put first mark as the value for maximum marks

	we check every mark from 2nd 

	if the mark is greater than the current highest value , the current mark will replace 	he highest value.

	make a variable for minimum marks and put the first value as minimum marks 

	we check every mark from the 2nd
	
	if the mark is less than current lowest value, then the current mark will replace the 	lowest value

	Print the highest and lowest value

Algorithm 2: 

3. Calculate Mean

	we make a variable to store sum of marks

	add mark to the sum ; we repeat this process to every mark in the array

	we calculate mean by dividing the sum by 30

4. Calculate standard deviation

	make a variable to store sum of squared difference from mean

	for every mark, we calculate the difference between mark and mean 

	square the difference and add it to the sum of squared difference

5. Calculate Variance

	divide the sum of squared differences by 30

	standard deviation is equal to the square root of variance

	print the standard deviation

	close the scanner
